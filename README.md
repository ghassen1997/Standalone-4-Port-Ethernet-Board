# Standalone-4-Port-Ethernet-Board

# Project Descreption : 

* The Device is a networking device used to connect multiple devices on a local area network (LAN). It operates at speeds of 10/100 Mbps, allowing for efficient data transfer between connected devices. This module was developed
as part of a freelance project For over 40 hours.

 # Design Requirments: 

* 5V Power Supply Input.

* The LAN Transformers can be placed on the bottom side. LAN Transformer is Low-Profile Abracon ALANL100X1-DE12DT or equivalent.

* PCB shall be 4-Layers and follow the KSZ8795 PCB Layout guide lines.

* ETH 1-4 are Molex Picoblade 4-pin Vertical connetors.

* LEDx_0 = Orange; LEDx_1 = Green.

* Add ETH Port ESD Protection: SP3051-04HTG.

* Top and bottom edge clearance: 1.5mm.

* 4x M2 Mouting Holes with 4.5mm screw head shall be integrated.

* PCB size is Fixed on 60x40m or less.

# TEST THE ETHERNET SWITCH BOARD

The Vedio demonstration Below  highlights the efficient performance and functionality of the Ethernet switch in a real-world scenario.

Note : The Board was Testing by one of The Team Belong To LABjOY Team and The Test Service is outsife the Scop of the Work
 
The video demonstrates the successful data transmission of the Ethernet switch, achieving speeds up to 37.64 MB/s. Additionally, it shows the activity of the Ethernet LEDs:

* Speed LED: The orange LED indicates the current link speed.
 
* Acknowledgment LED: The green LED signifies active data transmission and acknowledgment.

* The red LED indicates the successful delivery of power supply.

> [!NOTE]
>  The board was tested by a team from LABJOY, whose testing service falls outside the scope of the work being dealt with.
